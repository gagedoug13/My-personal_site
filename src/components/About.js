            <h2 className='firstAboutPage'>Hello! My name is Gage Thornberry and i'm a full-stack web developer from Oklahoma. I loved playing instruments as a kid, and when I got a little older I learned to make my own music with professional audio software. Seeing the endless potential in useful software inspired me to learn more about computer programming. I attended and graduated from Flatiron School's 15 week program for Software Engineering. </h2>
