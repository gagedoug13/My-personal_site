I loved playing instruments as a kid, and when I got a little older I started making my own music with professional audio software. Seeing the endless potential in useful software inspired me to learn more about computer programming. I attended and graduated from Flatiron School's 15 week program for Software Engineering in December 2019. </h2>

One of my biggest take-aways from the experience was my exposure to building projects with other people. It's important to know that you can always learn something from the person that you're working with. </h2>
